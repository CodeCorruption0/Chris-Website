                Although Chris is famous for the role of Thor, he nearly wasn’t.
                Thor was going to be his younger brother Liam but that was the
                problem, he was too young, although Liam didn’t get the
                position, they realized he had an older brother who was also an
                actor and they asked him about the role, and he agreed to it.
                Chris’s acting career started as King Arthur in a fantasy
                television series called
                <em>Guinevere Jones.</em>
